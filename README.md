The StemmaWing Backpack is compatible with FeatherWings that communicate via UART (RX/TX) or I2C (SDA/SCL) such as the Cedar Grove Classic MIDI FeatherWing. (https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/Classic_MIDI_FeatherWing). The backpack converts a FeatherWing into a self-powered, standalone Stemma device, sending UART or I2C signals through the Stemma interface connection. The backpack derives its power from either 3.3-volt or 5-volt incoming Stemma power. Stemma 2.0mm and Stemma-QT 1.0mm connector types are supported. 

For use ONLY with FeatherWings that require 3.3-volt power and that utilize UART or I2C signals. DO NOT attach to a Feather MCU board.
