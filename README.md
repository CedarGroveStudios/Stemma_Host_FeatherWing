The Stemma Host FeatherWing is a single Stemma or StemmaQT interface, compatible with the Adafruit Feather format. It is designed for use with a Feather MCU board such as the Feather M4 Express and will selectively communicate via UART (RX/TX) or I2C (SDA/SCL). The Stemma connector power is provided by the host Feather and is selectable for either 3 volts or ~5 volts. Stemma 2.0mm and Stemma-QT 1.0mm connector types are supported. 

For use ONLY with Feather MCU boards that provide at least a 3.3-volt power source. USB or battery power is needed for Stemma ~5-volt signals.
